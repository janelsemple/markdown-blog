# Markdown-blog

Markdown blog is a simple static site generated using next and markdown files. 

# How it works

Markdown blog reads in the contents of the posts folder, then uses the top-level yaml to generate cards that navigate to a page for each blog post. The markdown of each blog post is safely rendered using react-markdown.
